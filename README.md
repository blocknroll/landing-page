# Landing Page Project
----------------------

## Goal

The primary goal of the project is to use JavaScript to make a static page more dynamic.

## Features

__Navigation__
The navigation menu is built dynamically.
It grabs all the sections on the page,
makes a link for each one,
and adds it to an unordered list.

__Scroll to Anchor__
When clicking an item from the nav menu,
the link will scroll to the appropriate section.

__Section Active State__
While scrolling through the page,
the section most visible in the viewport
is highlighted, while the inactive sections
are dimmed.
